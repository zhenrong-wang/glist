# glist: A minimal implementation of generic linked-list using C

# 1. Background

Generic Programming is interesting. I just wonder whether it is possible in pure C. This project is a small practice for this purpose.

# 2. Brief Intro

**Purpose**: Create and manage generic linked-lists

**License**: MIT

# 3. How To Build

## 3.1 Prerequisites

You need a C compiler to build. 

- For Microsoft Windows users, [mingw-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) is required.
- For GNU/Linux Distro or other *nix users, the [GNU Compiler Collections](https://gcc.gnu.org/), known as gcc, is recommended.
- For macOS users, [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) is easy to install and use (brew is not needed to install clang on macOS).

### 3.2 Build

1. Use git to clone this code: `git clone https://github.com/zhenrong-wang/glist.git`
2. Build command example: `gcc *.c -o glist.exe`

# 4 Bugs and Communications

This code was written years ago, and I didn't continuously develop it. Therefore, bugs may occur. 

If you are interested in this project, please submit issues to this repo. I'd be glad to communicate on any issues.
